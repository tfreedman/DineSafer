Using Toronto Public Health's Food Premises Inspection and Disclosure System, DineSafer allows you to look up the inspection details of any restaurant in Toronto, and see its current status, as well as any historical health records regarding sanitation and cleanliness. You can search by name or address, and clicking a particular restaurant will show you any infraction details you might be interested in, along with the date the restaurant was last inspected. 

DineSafer runs completely offline, so you don't need to have Internet access. You can also use the app to find out a restaurant's address, just by typing in its name.
